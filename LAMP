Setting up a LAMP Stack on an EC2 Instance (Ubuntu Server)

In this guide, I will walk you through setting up a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) on an Amazon EC2 instance using Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS. This setup is ideal for developing and hosting dynamic web applications.

What makes up LAMP Stack

- Linux: The operating system (Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS).
- Apache: The web server for hosting webpages.
- MySQL: The database server for managing relational databases.
- PHP: The server-side scripting language for web development.

 Launching an EC2 Instance

1. **Sign in** to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to EC2 Dashboard and click Launch Instance.
3. Select Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS as the operating system.
4. Configure instance details such as the instance type, network, subnet, and security group.
5. Allocate storage based on your needs.
6. Set up a **security group** allowing inbound traffic on:
   - Port 22 (SSH)
   - Port 80 (HTTP)
   - Port 443 (HTTPS)
Connecting to the EC2 Instance

Once your instance is running, connect to it using SSH:

ssh -i path/to/key.pem ubuntu@3.85.8.54
```

Installing the LAMP Stack

Update Package Repository
sudo apt update

 Install Apache
sudo apt install apache2
```
Enable Apache to start on boot and check its status:

sudo systemctl enable apache2
sudo systemctl status apache2
```
Test the Apache installation by visiting your EC2 instance's public IP in a browser http://3.85.9.54:80
 3. Install MySQL
```bash
sudo apt install mysql-server
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

 4. Install PHP
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql


 Setting Up a Virtual Host

 1. Create Project Directory

sudo mkdir /var/www/projectlamp
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/projectlamp


2. Configure Virtual Host
Create a virtual host configuration file for your project:

sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/projectlamp.conf

Add the following content:

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    ServerName projectlamp
    ServerAlias www.projectlamp
    DocumentRoot /var/www/projectlamp
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>


3. Enable Virtual Host

sudo a2ensite projectlamp
sudo a2dissite 000-default
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

Step 5: Testing the Setup

Create an `index.html` file to verify your project setup:

echo "<h1>This is Marychein</h1>" > /var/www/projectlamp/index.html

Visit your domain or EC2 public IP to confirm the project is live.

Enabling PHP
To enable PHP processing, update the directory index configuration:

sudo nano /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf

Make sure `index.php` appears first:

DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.cgi index.pl index.xhtml index.htm


Reload Apache:

sudo systemctl reload apache2


Create a simple PHP file for testing:

echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > /var/www/projectlamp/index.php

Navigate to your project in a browser to confirm that PHP is working.


Conclusion

Setting up a LAMP stack on an AWS EC2 instance has provided me with hands-on experience in managing web servers and developing dynamic websites. This foundational knowledge is critical for scaling infrastructure, especially in cloud environments where performance and reliability are key.

I plan to leverage this skillset in future projects, particularly in DevOps and web development, where scalable and robust infrastructures are vital.
